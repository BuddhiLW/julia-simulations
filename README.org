** Bias coin-toss
Let $X_i$ be the bankroll, in the moment of the =i-th= coin-toss.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
X_{n}&=X_{n-1}+\,T_{k}\,B_{k} \\
\Leftrightarrow X_{n}&=X_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\,T_{k}\,B_{k}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The expectation is:
$E(X_{n})=X_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{n}E(B_{k}T_{k})=X_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{n}(p-q)E(B_{k})$

Following this formula, we can simulate these =Random Walks= and even measure, through Monte Carlo Method, the =Probability of Ruin=, given $(p,B_k)$, in which =T= is the outcome - either 1 or -1 (win or lose).

A four-volume work is placed in random order on a bookshelf. What is the
probability of the volumes being in proper order from left to right or from
right to left?
#+end_quote

*** Answer
The $(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)$, 4-tuple is the space we are dealing in.

There are $N=4!$ combinations possible for this space. And, only two that
benefits us, that is, in order of volumes from right to left, and left to right.

Therefore, the probability of these events happening randomly is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
P(A) &= \dfrac{N(A)}{N} \\
\Leftrightarrow P(A) &= \dfrac{2}{4!} \\
\Leftrightarrow  P(A) &= \dfrac{1}{12} \\
\therefore P(A) &= 0.0833

A wooden cube with painted faces is sawed up into 1000 little cubes, all of the
same size. The little cubes are then mixed up, and one is chosen at random
What is the probability of its having just 2 painted faces?

Ans: 0.096
#+end_quote

*** Answer
The space of colored sawed-cubes come all from the border of the former wooden
cube (supposedly). The inner sawed-cubes parts aren't painted.

Then, the cubes that only have two colors, must come from the edges of the cube,
but not from it's vertices - which would have three color-faces.

There are 12 edges; there are 8 vertices; each edge has 10 cubes, of which 8
aren't vertices - because there are 1000 sawed-cubes, of same volume
($\text{cubes} = 10*10*10$) and the two vertices in an edge are a cube of three
colored face.

Thus, the edge cubes that aren't vertices are: $(12 * 8)$.

The total cubes are =1000=.

$\therefore P(A) = 96/1000 \quad \leftrightarrow \quad P(A) = 0.096$

A batch of *n* manufactured items contains *k* defective items. Suppose *m*
items are selected at random from the batch. What is the probability that *l* of
these items are defective?
#+end_quote

*** Answer

- *n*: manufactured.
- *k*: defected out of the *n* defected.
- *m*: selection-size.
- *l*: number of selected items, out of the *m* selected, which are defected.

By =theorem 1.3=, given here, without proof (see the book for proof),
#+begin_quote
THEOREM 1.3.
A population of n elements has precisely
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_r^n = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
subpopulations of size r < n.
#+end_quote

So, your total number of combinations m-selections is exactly the =binomial
coeficient= $N=C_{m}^{n}$, or $\genfrac{(}{)}{0pt}{}{n}{k}$.

The total of combination of m-selections, in which =l= are defected, follows from:
- =l= of those =m=-selected are defected.
- There are =k= defected in the population.
- $l-m$ of the selected are not defected, and they come from the $n-m$ population of non-defected.

Thus, the number of possible combinations of selecting =l= from =m=, which are
defected can be numbered by: multiplying the combination =l=-selected from =k=
population, and the combination of (=l-m=)-selected from the (=n-m=) population.

$\therefore N(A)=C_{l}^{k} * C_{l-m}^{n-m}$

Finally, the probability of this event happening is:
$P(A)=\dfrac{N(A)}{N} \, \Leftrightarrow \, P(A)=\dfrac{C_{l}^{k} * C_{l-m}^{n-m}}{C_m^n}$

#+begin_quote
Ten books are placed in random order on a bookshelf. Find the probability
of three given books being side by side.

Ans: \dfrac{1}{15}
#+end_quote

*** Answer
**** Theorem of possible placements of books in a shelf (=BLW:1.1=)
Proof by /Induction/.

If we think of, for example, 4 books in total, and we take the first 3 to be our
side-by-side group. They could be the first three, or the last three. That is,
(4-3)+1 possible placements.

If that's true for =n-1= books, and =m= that we want side-by-side, that is:
((n-1)-m)+1. e.i., =n-m= placements, side-by-side, not-regarded of order. Then, if
we have =n+1= books.

Let's say the =n=-ith book in the shelf is not one of our =m= books (and, implicitly
assumed, is in the end of the shelf).

Then, we will have one more slot we can swap the =m= books further, with this new
book. Furthermore, the previous =(n-m)= places are still there. Therefore, we will
have =(n-m)+1= placements. QED.

**** Answer /per-se/
All possible arrangements are given by the factorial: $N=10!$

There are 10-3+1, i.e., 8, places the three books can be put side by side, by [[*Theorem of possible placements of books in a shelf
(=BLW:1.1=)][BLW:1.1]].

For each 7 placements, there can be 3! possible displacements. Furthermore, for
each of the possible combinations of side-by-side tree-books in a displacement,
there are 7! combinations for the rest of the books. That is, $N(A)=8(3!)(7!)$,
by =T1.1=, about the number of possible ordered-pairs.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\therefore P(A) &= \dfrac{N(A)}{N} \, \Leftrightarrow  \, P(A) = \dfrac{8(3!)(7!)}{10!}\\
\therefore P(A) &= \dfrac{1}{15}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

By Julia calculation:
#+begin_src julia
8*(factorial(3)*factorial(7))/(factorial(10))

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_src julia
1/15
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.06666666666666667

**** Another shorter solution
The number of possible subpopulations of the books is $C_3^{10}$. Out of these,
we want exactly one of them.

But, this subpopulation can be in (10-3)+1 possible displacements, by BLW:1.1.

$\therefore P(A) = \dfrac{8}{C_3^{10}} \, \Leftrightarrow \, P(A) = \dfrac{8(3!)(7!)}{10!}$

Thus, $P(A)=0.06667$, or $P(A)= \dfrac{1}{15}$.

#+begin_quote
1. One marksman has an 80% probability of hitting a target, while another has only a
70% probability of hitting the target. What is the probability of the target being hit (at least once) if both marksman fire at it simultaneously?
#+end_quote

*** Answer
#+begin_quote
The probability of the first marksman not hitting the target is 1 minus their
probability of hitting the target, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. Similarly, the
probability of the second marksman not hitting the target is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Since the marksmen are firing simultaneously, we can multiply the probabilities
together to find the probability of both marksmen missing the target: 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.06.

Finally, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of the
target being hit at least once: 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

Therefore, the probability of the target being hit (at least once) when both
marksmen fire at it simultaneously is 0.94 or 94%.
#+end_quote


Mathematically, the change of both not hitting:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
\implies P(A \cup B) &= 0.8 + 0.7 - 0.8*0.7 \\
\therefore P(A \cup B) &= 0.94
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Or,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
1-\overline{P(A \cup B)} &= 1-(\overline{P(A)} \cap \overline{P(B)}) \\
\implies 1-\overline{P(A \cup B)} &= 1 - (1-0.8) * (1-0.7) \\
\therefore  \implies 1-\overline{P(A \cup B)} = 0.94
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

#+begin_quote
Suppose n people sit down at random and independently of each other in an
auditorium containing n + k seats. What is the probability that m seats
specified in advance (m < n) will be occupied?
#+end_quote

*** Answer
**** ChatGPT (Wrong answer)
#+begin_quote
First, let's consider the total number of possible seating arrangements. There
are (n + k) seats available and n people to be seated. The number of ways to
arrange n people in (n + k) seats is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted
as C(n + k, n) or (n + k choose n). This can be calculated as:

C(n + k, n) = (n + k)! / (n! * k!)

Next, let's consider the number of ways to choose m specified seats, which are
the seats we want to be occupied. We can select m seats out of the available m +
k seats in C(m + k, m) ways, which is given by:

C(m + k, m) = (m + k)! / (m! * k!)

Finally, to find the probability that exactly m specified seats are occupied, we
divide the number of ways to have m occupied seats by the total number of
possible seating arrangements:

P(m seats occupied) = C(m + k, m) / C(n + k, n)

Therefore, the probability that m specified seats will be occupied is C(m + k,
m) / C(n + k, n).
#+end_quote

ChatGPT confuses itself in the following /reasoning/:
#+begin_quote
Next, let's consider the number of ways to choose m specified seats, which are
the seats we want to be occupied. We can select m seats out of the available m +
k seats in C(m + k, m) ways (...).
#+end_quote

**** Own answer
There are =C(n+k,n)= possible groups of sittings used by =n= people, in =n+k= sits.

We pre-arrange certain seats of =m=-size out of =n+k= available sits, in total a of =C(n+k, m)= arrangements.

But, only one =m=-sized grouping is of interest, namely the one in which all the =m=
pre-assigned sits are sit by a subgroup of =n= people. Furthermore, there are
$\dfrac{n!}{m!}$ arrangements possible, for this =m=-sized group of sits
of interest, which will be of *no concern*. Because, the possible ways to chose
=C(n+k,n)= doesn't consider order.

Still, we can still have =C(n-m+k, n-m)= possible grouping-of-fills of left-over placements.

Thus, $N(A)=1*C(n-m+k, n-m)$ are the number of events of interest. I.e., =n=-grouped sittings of which =m= are pre-assigned out of =n+k= sits. And =n-m= left open to possible groupings, in =n-m+k= sits.

And, $N=C(n+k,n)$ are the total arrangements of =n=-grouped sits.

C(n-m+k,\, n-m) = \dfrac{(n-m+k)!}{[(n-m+k)-(n-m)]!(n-m)!}

P = \dfrac{(\frac{n+2k-1}{2})! \times{} n!k!}{(k! (\frac{n-1}{2}))! \times{} (n+k)!}

Substituting =k=1=
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
P &= \dfrac{(\frac{n+1}{2})! \times{} n!}{(\frac{n-1}{2})! \times{} (n+1)!}\\
\implies P &= \dfrac{(\frac{n+1}{2})!}{(\frac{n-1}{2})! \times{} (n+1)} \\
\implies P &= \dfrac{(\frac{n+1}{2})(\frac{n-1}{2})!}{(\frac{n-1}{2})! \times{} (n+1)}\\
\implies P &= \dfrac{(\frac{n+1}{2})}{(n+1)} \\
\implies P &= \dfrac{(n+1)}{2\times(n+1)} \\
